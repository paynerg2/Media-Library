# Media Library

## Description

A tool to document the user's physical or digital media collection.
Intended to be a useful tool for collectors on the road who find themselves browsing at a shop and have to stop and ask "Do I have Issue #17 of this series already?"

## Motivation

This is a portfolio project built primarily with the goal of learning in mind.
As a collector of physical media, I've accidentally bought a duplicate of something that I already owned multiple times. This is meant to be a practical tool for cataloguing the items in a collection so that a quick lookup can be performed at a store or convention to determine which items are missing from the collection.

## Next Steps

No learning project is actually ever finished. This one is currently not being developed further, but I may return to it for a full refactor in the future. There's plenty of room for improvement.
